  <h1>Simon Game Instructions</h1>
    
  <h2>Setup</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Turn On the Game: Make sure the game is powered on. Some versions may have a power switch or button.</li>
      <li>Select Game Mode (if applicable): Some versions of Simon have different modes or difficulty settings. Select your desired mode.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Start the Game: Press the start button (usually located in the center of the device or indicated by a specific button).</li>
      <li>Watch the Sequence: The game will begin by lighting up one of the buttons and playing a corresponding tone. Pay attention to the color and the sequence.</li>
      <li>Repeat the Sequence: Once the game has shown the sequence, it’s your turn to repeat it by pressing the buttons in the same order. If the sequence was red, blue, green, you should press the red button, then the blue button, and finally the green button.</li>
      <li>Progressive Sequences: If you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add an additional step to the sequence and display it again. Your task is to repeat the entire new sequence.</li>
      <li>Continue Playing: The game continues to add one new step to the sequence each time you successfully repeat the previous sequence. Try to remember the entire sequence as it gets longer and more complex.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Scoring and Winning</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Score: Your score is typically the number of steps in the sequence you successfully complete.</li>
      <li>Winning: There is usually no "winning" per se, as the goal is to achieve the highest score possible. The game ends when you make a mistake by pressing the wrong button or forgetting the sequence.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Focus: Concentrate on the colors and tones.</li>
      <li>Break the Sequence into Chunks: Try to remember the sequence in smaller chunks rather than as a whole.</li>
      <li>Practice: Your memory and ability to recall sequences will improve with practice.</li>
  </ul>
